- The rule removes elements marked as `deprecated: true`
- Removal is recursive - if a component is marked as deprecated, all its references are removed
- When removing an endpoint, all its methods are removed
- The rule checks and resolves references ($ref) before making a decision to remove
- If `showDeprecatedDescriptions` is enabled, descriptions of all removed elements are output to the log
- The rule outputs warnings for ignored components that were not found
