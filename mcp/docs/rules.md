| Rule | Short Description |
|------------------------------------------------------------------| ---- |
| [change-content-type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/change-content-type/README.md) | Changes content types in the OpenAPI specification according to the replacement dictionary |
| [change-endpoints-basepath](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/change-endpoints-basepath/README.md) | Changes basepaths of endpoints according to the replacement dictionary |
| [filter-by-content-type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/filter-by-content-type/README.md) | The rule allows filtering content types in the OpenAPI specification.

| [filter-endpoints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/filter-endpoints/README.md) | The rule allows filtering endpoints in the OpenAPI specification based on their paths and methods. It enables explicit specification of which endpoints should be kept or removed from the specification. The rule supports both exact matching and regular expression-based filtering. |
| [merge-openapi-spec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/merge-openapi-spec/README.md) | Merges two OpenAPI specifications into one. Allows merging the current specification with an additional specification from a specified file. Supports working with files in JSON and YAML formats. |
| [patch-component-schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/patch-component-schema/README.md) | This rule allows modifying the component schema in the OpenAPI specification. |
| [patch-endpoint-parameter-schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/patch-endpoint-parameter-schema/README.md) | The rule allows modifying the schema of endpoint parameters in the OpenAPI specification. |
| [patch-endpoint-request-body-schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/patch-endpoint-request-body-schema/README.md) | Rule for modifying the request body schema in OpenAPI specification. Allows to modify the request schema for a specified endpoint. |
| [patch-endpoint-response-schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/patch-endpoint-response-schema/README.md) | The rule allows modifying the response schema for endpoints in the OpenAPI specification. |
| [patch-endpoint-schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/patch-endpoint-schema/README.md) | The rule allows modifying the entire endpoint schema in the OpenAPI specification. Unlike other patching rules that work with individual parts of the endpoint (parameters, request body, responses), this rule can modify the entire endpoint structure, including all its components. |
| [remove-deprecated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/remove-deprecated/README.md) | The rule allows removing deprecated elements from the OpenAPI specification. It can remove deprecated components, endpoints, parameters, and properties, while providing the ability to ignore specific elements and display descriptions of removed elements. |
| [remove-max-items](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/remove-max-items/README.md) | Removes the `maxItems` property from all schemas in the OpenAPI specification. |
| [remove-min-items](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/remove-min-items/README.md) | Removes the `minItems` property from all schemas in the OpenAPI specification. |
| [remove-operation-id](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/remove-operation-id/README.md) | Removes operationId from all operations in the OpenAPI specification, except those specified in the ignore list |
| [remove-parameter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/remove-parameter/README.md) | Removes a parameter from an endpoint in the OpenAPI specification |
| [remove-unused-components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itwillwork/openapi-modifier/refs/heads/main/src/rules/remove-unused-components/README.md) | Removes unused components from the OpenAPI specification. The rule analyzes all component references in the document and removes those that are not used anywhere. |
