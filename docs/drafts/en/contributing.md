# Adding a New Rule

You need to add a folder with the name of the newly created rule to the `src/rules` directory with 6 files:

- `index.ts` - main file with rule logic - must export: `processor` (default export) and `configSchema` (named export)
- `index.test.ts` - tests for the rule covering all configuration fields and usage examples
- `/docs/{lang}/_description.md` - file with rule description
- `/docs/{lang}/_motivation.md` - file with description of rule motivation with examples (in which cases it can be useful in practice)
- `/docs/{lang}/_config.md` - file with rule configuration description

For detailed logs needed for debugging [see "Debugging" section](#custom_anchor_debug).

All rule names must start with an action designation.
